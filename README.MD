### Create a form in React and Display the Results in the same page:

We store a lot of form data in our databases. A frequent task would be to fetch the form data, render it, validate it and modify any changes. The following is a basic implementation of such a function:
Feel free to use any boilerplate (like CRA) or UI framework (like Material UI) you want.

We care about code that is readable (even without comments), non-repeating (within reason) and structured well.
Avoid third party libraries for form handling (like react-form, simple-react-form etc). 

1. Create a form in React.js which takes `Name, Age, Email, Phone Number`, Upon sucessful submit. Show the responses in the same page beside the form.
2. Each field must have validations:
- Required / Not Required
- Number, String and Email
- Min/Max length
3. Show validation errors with a red colour indication.
4. Put in a reset button and a submit button.
5. On submit, any errors should be displayed at the bottom of appropriate field. Responses must be showed beside the form.
6. Bonus: If you can implement this with the form data fetched and updated using MobX, context API or Redux.
